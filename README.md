Rimworld Crafting Hysteresis mod

Are you tired of your cooks leaping into action the instant someone decides they want a snack? Would you like them to just *calm down for a bit* and not panic?

Crafting Hysteresis is for you! This allows you to make crafting bills that go to sleep once they're complete, waking up only once your stocks drop below a certain number. Now your chefs can craft up to 50 food, then go do other more important things for a while!
